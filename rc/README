Initramfs/initrd gets root mounted read-only and runs rc.nfsroot
instead of init.

rc.nfsroot tries each of the rc.nfsroot-<method> scripts in $METHODS
order until one doesn't return, indicating success.  The successful
script will exec rc.nfsroot-init.

rc.nfsroot-init does some further rw root setup and execs $INITPROG.
